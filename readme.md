Simple command line utility that lets you quickly authorize an app with a Twitter account, and get the corresponding access token and secret.
Works by starting a local HTTP server that handles the OAuth callback.

This is a NodeJS-based alternative to [twitter/twurl](https://github.com/twitter/twurl) and [k0kubun/twitter-auth](https://github.com/k0kubun/twitter-auth).

## Install

- ðŸ“¦ [npm](http://npmjs.com/package/twitter-auth-cli): `npm i -g twitter-auth-cli`

## Usage

In order to use this tool, you need your app's API key and secret.
You can get them from Twitter's [developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/apps).

Then, run the tool with the following command:

```yml
twitter-auth-cli --apiKey XXXX --apiSecret YYYY
```

> **Note**:
> You can run the tool without installing it by using `npx twitter-auth-cli ...`.

This should guide you through the next steps:

```yml
-- Step 1: Enable OAuth 1.0a --
Go to https://developer.twitter.com/apps and enable OAuth 1.0a for your app.

-- Step 2: Add callback URL --
Add the following callback URL in the OAuth 1.0a settings of your app:
http://localhost:3000/

-- Step 3: Authorize the app --
Open the following URL in your browser to authorize the app:
https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authenticate?oauth_token=XXXXXXXXX
```

Open the OAuth challenge in your browser and authorize the app with your account.
After that's done, you should see the following output in the terminal:

```yml
-- Authorization successful --
Use the following credentials to access Twitter API on behalf of your account:
Access token: XXXXXXX
Access secret: YYYYYYY
```

> **Note**:
> You need to add the callback URL to your app's OAuth settings in order for this tool to work.
> If you need to change the port on which the callback server runs, you can do so with the `--port <value>` option.
